## Kill x birds with x-1 stones!
This is a Windows Phone 7 game I made as one of the final projects in my Grade 12 programming class... Now that I think about it, it was kind of crazy to me that they were expecting us to make four fully-functioning programs in a semester...and that three of the four were games.

Because this was an actual project for me, this repository contains some stuff I wouldn't normally include in my usual mini-projects, like flowcharts and detailed comments and an actual readme file.

...Also, yes, I'm aware naming things clearly was not my strong suit.

## Original readme to my programming teacher
This game is about throwing stones at birds! ...And seeing how they
interact with each other, I guess. To tell you the truth, the idea came
from out of nowhere when I thought "Kill 2 birds with 1 stone". Also, the
"2015" part was since general simulator games and other things with years in
their name seem to always be one year ahead, and it IS technically 2014
now.

Anyway, you throw stones at birds, and you score is determined by how
many stones you threw versus how many birds you hit. Needless to say...
I'd be surprised if anyone passed zero points...unless they were really
lucky. Anyway, the throwing power of throwing the stones depends on how
far away the user touches the screen from the player. Usually tapping the
bird that's flying will usually get it.

Also, the sound effects can all be credited to SoundJay.com. Pretty much
all of the graphical assets were drawn by me in GIMP, which actually
supports transparency, unlike MS Paint.
